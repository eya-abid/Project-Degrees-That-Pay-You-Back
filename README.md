# Project-Degrees-That-Pay-You-Back

Wondering if that Philosophy major will really help you pay the bills? Think you're set with an Engineering degree? Whether you're in school or navigating the postgrad world, this project will guide you in exploring the short- and long-term financial implications of this major decision.
After doing some data clean up, we'll compare the recommendations from three different methods for determining the optimal number of clusters, apply a k-means cluster analysis, and visualize the results.

This project assumes familiarity with standard tidyverse tools for R. While not required, it would also be helpful to have a prior understanding of clustering unsupervised data with k-means.

The dataset used in this project is made available here: http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/info-Degrees_that_Pay_you_Back-sort.html?mod=article_inline by the Wall Street Journal.
